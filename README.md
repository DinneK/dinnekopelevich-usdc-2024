## About The Project
In the captivating journey of crafting this project, I embraced the challenge of conceptualizing an expansive library of books. This endeavor aimed to create a seamless experience for users, akin to navigating a physical library where one could search for a term and receive a corresponding book (object). Much like the process of searching for a keyword in a library book, users could then "check out" the digital equivalent, obtaining the information they sought. As I delved into the intricacies of this project, my focus extended far beyond the mere implementation of code; I sought to immerse myself in the user's perspective. Questions like, "What is the user truly seeking?" and "Is a keyword search sufficient, or would users prefer searching by title?" became pivotal considerations. Anticipating and addressing the diverse needs and expectations of end users became a guiding principle, infusing depth and empathy into every facet of the development process.

## Instructions

# findSearchTermInBooks

Included in this repository are files to support candidates applying for software engineering roles through the GSA's U.S. Digital Corps program. 

There are three files in this repository we would like you to focus on:

1. This README.
1. `tester.html`: An HTML file that will run your code.
1. `book_search.js`: A JavaScript source code file that you should edit for your assessment submission.

## Testing your code

You will need to open the file `tester.html` in a browser to run the code that is contained in `book_search.js`. The output from running that code will appear in the browser's web developer console. Here is documentation for opening the web developer tools for Firefox:

https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/browser_console/index.html#:~:text=You%20can%20open%20the%20Browser,%2B%20J%20on%20a%20Mac

And here are the instructions for Google Chrome:

https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/open/

Either should work; we tested under both on Mac and Linux.

You will submit both the HTML and JavaScript files when you are done. You should not need to edit `tester.html`. We expect all of your work to appear in the file `book_search.js`. 

## Submission

Directions for submission are in the prompt. As a reminder, you should commit your code to a repository called

*firstnamelastname*-usdc-2023

If you were remarkable technologists of years past, you might name your repository

`otisboykin-usdc-2023`

or 

`mariebrown-usdc-2023`

You, of course, should name your repository for the remarkable technologist of civic tech's future that you are.
